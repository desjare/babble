# babble

Babble is an experimental project that is not working and unfinished. It was my first project in Go. The goal of the project was to detect french mistakes on the web. 

The idea was to crawl the web and collect sentences doing sentences detection. Then, process the sentences using [DELA](http://infolingu.univ-mlv.fr/DonneesLinguistiques/Dictionnaires/telechargement.html) to collect information on how sentences are built.

Using the collected information, we could possibly using ml detect mistakes since DELA provides us with a lot of information about words. If a word is masculine or feminine, singular or plural. You can also know what type of word it is or verb tense as well as many many other useful information.

I never finished it and keep it for reference.
